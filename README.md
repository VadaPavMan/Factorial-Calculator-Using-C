# Factorial-Calculator-Using-C
This is a simple C program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. Factorials are mathematical functions used in permutations, combinations, and other areas of mathematics. The program handles edge cases such as negative numbers, where factorials are not defined.

### How It Works
The user is prompted to enter a number.
If the entered number is negative, the program outputs a message stating that factorials are not defined for negative numbers.
If the number is non-negative, the program calculates the factorial using a loop and displays the result.

Example Output
For an input of 5, the output will be: 
```
Enter the number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120

```
